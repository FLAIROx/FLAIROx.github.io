  abstract =      {Evidence exists that people do not always make
                   decisions involving uncertain monetary rewards as if
                   they were maximizing expected utility of final
                   assets. Explanations for this behavior postulate that
                   the cognitive demands of consistency to such a theory
                   are too great. However, situations exist in which
                   more than mental shortcuts are involved and these
                   anomalies raise questions about expected utility
                   theory as a guide to behavior. This paper explores
                   the possibility that expected utility theory appears
                   to fail because the single outcome
                   descriptor-money-is not sufficient. After making a
                   decision under uncertainty, a person may discover, on
                   learning the relevant outcomes, that another
                   alternative would have been preferable. This
                   knowledge may impart a sense of loss, or regret. The
                   decision maker who is prepared to tradeoff financial
                   return in order to avoid regret will exhibit some of
                   the behavioral paradoxes of decision theory. By
                   explicitly incorporating regret, expected utility
                   theory not only becomes a better descriptive
                   predictor but also may become a more convincing guide
                   for prescribing behavior to decision makers.},

  abstract =      {Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and
                   improved computational speeds have led to recent
                   successes in the field of reinforcement learning
                   (RL). However, most current RL-based approaches fail
                   to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation
                   and real world is so large that policy-learning
                   approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy
                   learning is done in real world, the data scarcity
                   leads to failed generalization from training to test
                   scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object
                   masses). Inspired from H-infinity control methods, we
                   note that both modeling errors and differences in
                   training and test scenarios can just be viewed as
                   extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper
                   proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement
                   learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate
                   in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that
                   applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly
                   trained adversary is reinforced – that is, it
                   learns an optimal destabilization policy. We
                   formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax
                   objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple
                   environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer,
                   Hopper, Walker2d and Ant) conclusively demonstrate
                   that our method (a) improves training stability; (b)
                   is robust to differences in training/test conditions;
                   and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of
                   the adversary.},
